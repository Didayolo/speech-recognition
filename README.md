# Speech Recognition

### Algorithm that understands simple speech commands

The purpose of this project is to do [TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).


The Speech Commands Datasets includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.


To run the project, it is required to have `train` and `test` repository in a `data` repository.
